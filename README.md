# algo-neuro
Algo-NEURO Is a preconfigured system to allow programmers to create their
own neural networks on the Cloud compatible with any natural language
in the world even if you think about using non-existent languages as long as it is based
and adapted to the universal execution environment (EEU or URE). Every programmer
is free to create and teach its own neurons the information that it needs
seem understandable in order to meet the needs.

Speaking of the Universal Execution Environment, programmers can
also create or adapt their existing systems to the neural networks they
should create from the Algo-NEURO system or Cloud in order to meet the
needs of their customers, or to make their systems or programming languages
universal adapted to any natural language or non-existent in the world. YOU
are free to teach your neurons any information of any
language, subsequently the Algo-NEURO system executes or responds to your requests.

The free version offered allows you to create as many neurons as possible
according to your information, integrated into the network and all this without even paying a fee. THE
same neurons created or added to your network free tests, can be
freely added to the Algo-NEURO Cloud to allow programmers to
adapt it correctly to their systems thanks to operational APIs and
exploit it to those who want to integrate it into their business ChatBot, robots, and others
systems.

In this case, the free version offered can be used only on the console (Terminal)
of the Universal Execution Environment (EEU or URE) as shown in the image below

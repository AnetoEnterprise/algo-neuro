# algo-neuro
Algo-NEURO Is a preconfigured system to allow programmers to create their
own neural networks on the Cloud compatible with any natural language
in the world even if you think about using non-existent languages as long as it is based
and adapted to the universal execution environment (EEU or URE). Every programmer
is free to create and teach its own neurons the information that it needs
seem understandable in order to meet the needs.

Speaking of the Universal Execution Environment, programmers can
also create or adapt their existing systems to the neural networks they
should create from the Algo-NEURO system or Cloud in order to meet the
needs of their customers, or to make their systems or programming languages
universal adapted to any natural language or non-existent in the world. YOU
are free to teach your neurons any information of any
language, subsequently the Algo-NEURO system executes or responds to your requests.

The free version offered allows you to create as many neurons as possible
according to your information, integrated into the network and all this without even paying a fee. THE
same neurons created or added to your network free tests, can be
freely added to the Algo-NEURO Cloud to allow programmers to
adapt it correctly to their systems thanks to operational APIs and
exploit it to those who want to integrate it into their business ChatBot, robots, and others
systems.

In this case, the free version offered can be used only on the console (Terminal)
of the Universal Execution Environment (EEU or URE) as shown in the image below
After :

Once tested the behavior of your neurons, you will be free to export it in
completely secure on the Algo-NEURO Cloud. In this case, you must first install
and configure the Universal Execution Environment (EEU or URE) as needed to
that the Algo-NEURO system is functioning correctly to ensure your tests. To
Learn more about installing the Universal Runtime Environment, please
refer to https://sourceforge.net/projects/ure. And find the compatible version at
your operating system.

After installing and configuring the universal execution environment, it is
high time to install Algo-NEURO and create your neurons
as much as you want.

# 1. Installation :
Download the compatible version of your system. As you can see, in the image
following from our hard drive, the downloaded files, we have all the
Windows and Linux versions for testing:

In this example the images shown were captured from the
Windows10 platform using MINGW64. You are free to use
any terminal or even the default Windows command prompt
as shown in this image:

You can install the TAR or ZIP version, or choose the version
installation using the Windows installer (SETUP) by following the procedures
installation instructions as shown in the following images:

You have just correctly installed the Algo-NEURO for real-world testing. Now, he
All we have to do is configure the environment and create our neurons for testing.

# 2. Configuration:
The configuration of Algo-NEURO is not mandatory. But it makes sense to do it
if and only if you want the error results to be displayed to your
natural language as long as the default language used is French.

In this case, you must go to the environment directory
universal runtime (C:/URE) on Windows or (/usr/share/ure) on Linux and
to find the lang.conf configuration file as in the image below:

You are free to modify and translate the information contained in this file
to the language of your choice except that the codes do not need to be modified or
translate. You will have more details regarding these codes from the page of
the universal execution environment (EEU or URE). Let's now move on to the
creation of our neurons and their learning.

Let's now install the internal memory of our neurons:

Follow the installation procedures to properly perform your tests.

# 3. Creation of neurons and supervised learning:
Below you will understand the different syntaxes offered by Algo-
NEURO to allow you to properly create, learn and test your
neurons from any terminal. In this case, you will find from the
directory C:\URE\lib on Windows, or /usr/share/ure/lib on Linux a
file test_neurones_syntaxes.txt. This file contains the syntaxes that will
allow you to create your neurons, to teach them information to your
needs and test their functionality easily.

![alt text](https://github.com/AnetoEnterprise/algo-neuro/blob/main/Captures/Capture10.png)

You can translate it according to your understandable language to ensure your tests
and other procedures. With this example, our syntaxes from the file are in
French.

If you had translated them to a language other than the default one, on the
terminal also you must perform the operations in this translated language to
that it works successfully. On the other hand, you will come across messages from
errors.

Before proceeding with the following syntaxes, you must first make a call
to your syntax file on the console. Launch Command Prompt or
MINGW64 and execute the command :s:test_neurones_syntaxes.txt as
on the image :

![alt text](https://github.com/AnetoEnterprise/algo-neuro/blob/main/Captures/Capture11.png)

And proceed with the following commands according to your needs:

# 3.1 Creation of neurons and supervised learning :
```shell
neurone superviseur=("Your information here");
```

The supervisor neuron command, as its name suggests, allows
developers to create and supervise the learning of their
neurons so that they can be used in the future as a network of
universal and understandable neurons.

# 3.2 Updating information in a neuron:
```shell
neurone superviseur de mises Ã  jour=("Your old information
here","Your new information here");
```

It turns out that your neural network is no longer up to date and you would like to
update the information contained in certain neurons, the
command above will do the trick.

# 3.3 Communication between administrator and system:
```shell
neurone superviseur des questions=("");
```

This command is used to initiate the conversation between the administrator of the
network and the mother system of your neurons. It turns out that your network of
neurons had not understood certain information and which meant that it
responds with bad information. The neuron command
question supervisor will allow the system to display all questions
information that was incorrectly answered so that the administrator
manages to respond correctly and which will ensure that your neurons
learn the new information again.

# 3.4 Test :
```shell
neurone=("Your test information here");
```

And for the last command, allows you to carry out the tests of all this
that you have taught your system (neural network) so that it
correctly meets your needs. It plays the role of a dendrite
input (INPUT) for transmitting input information to
neurons in the network. In other words, a dedicated testing ChatBot on the
console in order to respond to the Algo-NEURO system.
